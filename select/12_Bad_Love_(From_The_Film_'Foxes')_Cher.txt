(From the movie "Foxes")

Looking for some bad love in the night,
Feeling such a hot street I could find,
Need to have some bad, bad love to make it right.

I used to be a good girl, but no more,
I'm ready, now it's I learn to score,
Guess I know that bad love is my appetite.

Wanna find some hot shot on the street,
We'll make the fire and there'll be the heat,
Knew I wanna burn my candle at the dance.

I wanna meet a bad boy in the night,
We're gonna make some bad love, wrong or right,
Ooh, I know that bad love is all appetite.

Ooooh, baby baby, I'm ready,
Oooooooh, baby give it to me,
Am I gonna know the view and that it'll show me the right way,
You got me bangin' on the floor,
Now what more do you want from me.

Bad boy in the night,
We're gonna learn some new tricks, wrong or right,
We need to have some bad, bad love to make it right.

We're gonna make some hot love on the street,
We'll make the fire, then we'll feel the heat,
Ooh, I'm gonna bad, bad la la lala,
Bad, bad la la lala
Bad love gets us through the night.

Ooooh, baby baby, I'm ready,
Oooooooh, baby give it to me,
Am I gonna know the view and that it'll show me the right way,
You got me bangin' on the floor,
Now what more do you want from me.

Bad love in the night,
We're gonna make some new tricks, wrong or right,
All I know that bad love is out appetite.

We're gonna make some hot love on the street,
We'll make the fire, then we'll feel the heat,
Ooh, I'm gonna bad, bad la la lala,
Bad, bad la la lala
