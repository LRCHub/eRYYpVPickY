[00:56.35] Oh, what a feeling I get when I'm with you
[01:03.92] You take my heart into everything you do
[01:11.06] And it makes me sad for the lonely people
[01:15.70] I walked that road for so long
[01:18.99] Now I know that I'm one of the lucky people
[01:23.55] Your love is making me strong
[01:38.05] 
[01:26.78] I've had enough of bad love
[01:30.49] I need something I can be proud of
[01:34.15] I've had enough of bad love
[01:39.24] No more bad love
[01:47.24] 
[01:57.84] And now I see that my life has been so blue
[02:05.74] With all the heartaches I had 'till I met you
[02:12.74] But I'm glad to say now that's all behind me
[02:17.48] With you here by my side
[02:20.64] And there's no more memories to remind me
[02:25.11] Your love will keep me alive
[02:39.11] 
[02:28.18] I've had enough of bad love
[02:32.12] I need something I can be proud of
[02:35.62] I've had enough bad love
[02:40.65] No more bad love
[02:48.65] 
[04:04.06] I've had enough of bad love
[04:08.17] I need something I can be proud of
[04:11.89] I've had enough of bad love
[04:16.58] No more bad love
[04:24.58] 
[04:19.52] Had enough of bad love
[04:23.32] I need something I can be proud of
[04:27.28] I've had enough of bad love
[04:32.18] No more bad love
[04:40.18] 
[04:34.80] I've had enough
[04:42.51] I've had enough
[04:47.07] No more bad love
[04:49.93] Had enough
[04:57.66] I've had enough
[05:02.22] No more bad love
