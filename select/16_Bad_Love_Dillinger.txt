Bad time for the takin
Such a bad time had to let it go
My heart was a breakin
As I packed it up and I hit the road
Ya know it's really kinda funny
Ya never know what ya got till it's gone
And when I think about it honey
It's so damn hard just to carry on
Cuz it was
Bad love, bad love
From the first kiss baby to
The very last touch
Real bad love
Though we tried and we tried
We just couldn't get along
Been a month on my own now
Found a new job to occupy my time
Must of been with a million girls
But I can't seem to get you off my mind
I wonder how you're doin baby
Have you found a new man
That can fill my shoes
My friends try to persuade me
They say forget about her man
Cuz she's just bad news, cuz it was
Bad love, bad love
From the first kiss baby to
The very last touch
Real bad love oohoo
Wait a minute somethin's wrong
Ya know, I never felt this before
Got a feelin that its more than that
But I, can't seem to find the write words to say
Oh, baby it's much too late, yeah
Cause it was, Bad love, bad love
From the first kiss to the very last touch
Real bad love, yeah
Bad love, real bad love, ooh
Real bad love
Cuz it was bad love
