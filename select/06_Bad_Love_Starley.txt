Ooh, I saw it all in your eyes
Got a feeling that it's all bad
Tell me why it's feeling all bad
And if you gave your love, don't say
'Cause lying is the brand new truth
And I'll get even with you someday
So you can feel it too babe

Just take me to hell and back
'Cause I can't live without your bad
Just take me to hell and back
'Cause I can't live without your baad
Your bad, your bad love
Your bad, your bad, your bad love

Yeah, I tumble every time you chase me
The scars you leave and I can't hide
I tell you every time you hold me
That this will be the very last time
And I think I should check myself in
'Cause the pain is everywhere I go, babe
And your taste is my dopamine
When you tell your bad lies

Yeah, just take me to hell and back
'Cause I can't live without your bad
Just take me to hell and back
'Cause I can't live without your bad
Your bad, your bad love
Your bad, your bad, your bad love

Ohh, ooh, oh
Ohh, ooh, oh
'Cause the pain is everywhere I go
And your taste is my dopamine, hey
'Cause the pain is everywhere I go, babe
And the taste is my dopamine, ay, yeah
Ay, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Hmm

Hey, just take me to hell and back
'Cause I can't live without your bad
Just take me to hell and back
'Cause I can't live without your bad
Your bad, your bad love
Your bad, your bad, your bad love
