# HANA – BAD LOVE

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Want some time
Get out of my life
I smile to hide, saying I'm alright
思い出したくないのに消えない
眠らせてよもう今日ぐらい
I didn't know 何も知らなかった私を
騙してyou smiled
and you never said goodbye
cause I'm always the good one right?
言えよ yes or no
You did cross the line
I was always blind
go ahead and blame me
あなたなら
信じ切ってた 愛してた
What about you what about you
I cannot forgive you
then I'm gonna miss you
何も言えなかったto you
cause I'm just a kid, I'm just a kid
You don't know how much I loved you
言ってたのに絶対だって
I don't know if I'm ready or not
許してよ
cause I'm just a kid, just a kid
Promised me the world
Then you locked me in the walls
Something went so wrong
Tryna cut you off
Then I hear you, it's your voice
You know what I'm dying for
Yeah, I don't wanna write this song, honestly
痛い記憶が killing me
今でも聞きたいのはこれだけ say "Sorry"
Yeah, You took away my lights and gave me
nothing back
I have become stronger
Cuz I had to start over on my own
You did cross the line
I was always blind
go ahead and blame me
あなたなら
信じ切ってた 愛してた
What about you what about you
I cannot forgive you
then I'm gonna miss you
何も言えなかったto you
cause I'm just a kid, I'm just a kid
You don't know how much I loved you
言ってたのに絶対だって
I don't know if I'm ready or not
許してよ
cause I'm just a kid, I'm just a kid
All a lie
Nothing's fine
Can't forgive you
Hate that I
Still sometimes
Need to need you
I cannot forgive you
then I'm gonna miss you
何も言えなかったto you
cause I'm still a kid, still a kid
I cannot forgive you
I don't wanna miss you
今でも痛い、痛い、少し
Yeah, cause I'm just a kid, I'm just a kid
